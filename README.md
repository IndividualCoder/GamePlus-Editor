# GamePlus editor is a gui editor for ursina engine.
It is the single-developer version. 


This editor will currently write your games in python. But I'll add the feture to turn your .py into .exe ^_~

## Tip
If you don't want to pay me for the multi-developer version, you can make a group for all developers on a chatting platform like discord and then zip the files and share the file to your group.
