# UrsinaEditor is a gui editor for ursina engine.
It is the single-developer version. 

# Important
This editor will currently write your games in python. But I'll add the feture to turn your py files to cpp and then to exe.

# Multi-developer version is private
If you are a single person developing the game. This version is good for you.
If you are a team developing the game. It's not for you.

# Tip
If you don't want to pay me for the multi-developer version, you can make a group for all developers on a chatting platform like discord and then zip the files and share the file to your group.
